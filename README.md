# CoronaDistanceIOS.1

This app utilizes Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) through IBeacon and Core Location libraries.

Anyone who downloads this app will have their Unique User Identifier (UUID) set so that anyone else who has downloaded this app
will be alerted if someone enters a certain radius to ensure social distancing.

A news feed is also provided so that users can stay informed and educated in the turbulent times we find ourselves in.

The goal of our project is to promote social health and awareness so that we can all try and practice living healthier lives
during this pandemic.
